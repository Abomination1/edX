We are happy to announce that the C Programming with Linux professional certificate program has been extended to December 31, 2019. All audit and verified certificate learners will be able to continue working on the courses until the end of the year. Your work, progress scores, and discussions will continue to be available throughout this current run of the courses (2018-19).

New learners may join the courses anytime, however after March 20, 2019, new audit learners will have seven weeks of access to each course. This change is due to a change in edX policy going forward. Audit learners who joined the courses prior to March 20, 2019 will see no change. Both existing and new Verified Certificate learners will have full access to courses with no time limits.

Due to the seven week limit for audit learners, we recommend that you enroll in the courses one at a time.

As always, we welcome your feedback in the discussion forums and on the End of Course Feedback survey.
